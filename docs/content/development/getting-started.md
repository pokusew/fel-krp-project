# Getting Started

Set up development environment, build the sources, and run LionKey.

## Requirements

- [CMake] _(tested with version 3.30.5)_

  - Note: [CLion](#using-ide) has a bundled CMake so there is no need to install it.

- [Arm GNU Toolchain] _(tested with Version 14.2.Rel1)_

  - Download _AArch32 bare-metal target (arm-none-eabi)_ from the Arm website [here][Arm GNU Toolchain].
  - On macOS, `brew install --cask gcc-arm-embedded` can be used.

- [OpenOCD] or any other tool for programming and debugging Arm Cortex-M microcontrollers,
  such as pyOCD or ST-LINK_gdbserver (a part of STM32CubeIDE).

  :::danger[Caution]

  **STM32H5** does not work with the original OpenOCD.
  Currently, it only works with the STMicroelectronics' fork [STMicroelectronics/OpenOCD],
  which has to be built from source, **see ðŸ‘‰ [this guide for the instructions](./openocd)**

  :::

## Cloning the Project

The project uses [Git submodules] to manage some of the external dependencies (see [.gitmodules](https://github.com/pokusew/lionkey/blob/main/.gitmodules)).

There are two options how to get the contents of the submodules:

**When cloning the project**, you can use:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pokusew/lionkey.git
```

**If you already cloned the project** and forgot `--recurse-submodules`, you can use:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Build from the Command Line

It is possible to build, flash and start the whole project from the command line.

Building is done via `cmake` since this project is a standard [CMake] project (see [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/pokusew/lionkey/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt)).
We also included a [CMakePresets.json](https://github.com/pokusew/lionkey/blob/main/CMakePresets.json) to simplify passing common options.

Here is an example how to build the executable for the NUCLEO-H533RE board with the STM32H533RET6 MCU.

```bash
# configure step (only has to be done once)
cmake --preset stm32h533-debug
# build step
cmake --build --preset stm32h533-debug
```

Flashing can be done for example using `openocd` like this (run from the project root):

```bash
openocd -s /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts -f targets/stm32h533/st_nucleo_h5.cfg -c 'tcl_port disabled' -c 'gdb_port disabled' -c 'program "build/stm32h533-debug/targets/stm32h533/lionkey_stm32h533.elf"' -c reset -c shutdown
```

## Using IDE

**Use JetBrains [CLion] (free for non-commercial use) for development.**
The project is already imported and fully configured, use _File > Open..._ to just open it.

If you have all the [tools](#requirements) installed, you should be able to open, build and run the project from CLion.

You can read more in this [CLion's Embedded development with STM32CubeMX projects][CLion-Embedded-Development]
guide.

Note that CLion bundles CMake (and other tools). Those can be used outside CLion from terminal as well.
On a x64 macOS system, the CLion's `cmake` binary
is located at `/Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/x64/bin/cmake`.
If you add the `/Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/x64/bin/` dir to your PATH,
then you can run CLion's CMake just by typing `cmake` in your terminal.

## SVD file for the MCU

CLion and other IDEs support SVD files for describing the layout of registers for debugging.

See the [README in the tools/svd dir](https://github.com/pokusew/lionkey/blob/main/tools/svd/README.md) which lists the available SVD files you can use.
