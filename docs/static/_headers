# Docusaurus outputs all assets with hash to the assets dir
#   see https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/3998
# webpack rules for JS and CSS files are provided by @docusaurus/core
#   ([contenthash:8] with hashFunction set to xxhash64)
#   JS: 'assets/js/[name].[contenthash:8].js'
#     https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/main/packages/docusaurus/src/webpack/base.ts#L208-L214
#   CSS: 'assets/css/[name].[contenthash:8].css'
#     https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/main/packages/docusaurus/src/webpack/base.ts#L342-L347
# webpack rules for static assets are provided by @docusaurus/utils
#   ([contenthash] with the default hashFunction (md4))
#   see https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/main/packages/docusaurus-utils/src/webpackUtils.ts#L68
# note: webpack bundles hash functions, see https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/main/assembly/hash

# add Cache-Control to assets with hash
/assets/*
	Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

# partial workaround for the problematic /404 behavior
#   Problem:
#     The the 404 error page (the assets.not_found_handling feature)
#     is accessible at /404 with the 200 OK status code.
#     It should be served with the 404 Not Found status code,
#     just like when it is returned for some non-existent URL.
#   See the discussion about this problematic behavior here:
#     https://community.cloudflare.com/t/how-to-make-404-html-return-404-status-code/662019
#   See docs for the assets.not_found_handling feature:
#     https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/static-site-generation/#custom-404-pages
#   Note: Even the official Cloudflare websites have this problem:
#     https://www.cloudflare.com/404/ -> returns 200 OK instead of 404 Not Found
#     https://developers.cloudflare.com/404 -> returns 200 OK instead of 404 Not Found
#   Possible solutions:
#     1. Rewrite the status code using the _redirects file -> currently not supported
#        (see the comment in the _redirects file for more info)
#     2. Use some Cloudflare Rule on the domain/zone change HTTP response status code when path == /404
#        -> not possible, no such rule exists (note: a paid WAF rule could be abused for this)
#     3. (partial workaround)
#        At least, add the X-Robots-Tag header with the noindex value
#        to prevent the actual /404 path to be indexed.
/404
	X-Robots-Tag: noindex

# prevent *.workers.dev URLs from being indexed
# (the production deployment uses custom domain)
https://*.workers.dev/*
	X-Robots-Tag: noindex
